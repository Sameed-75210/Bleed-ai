For Windows:

``` python -m venv venv ```
``` .\venv\Scripts\activate ```

For macOS and Linux:

``` python3 -m venv venv ```
``` source venv/bin/activate ```

Install the required dependencies:

``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```


# Running the application
Start the FastAPI server by running:

``` uvicorn app:app --reload ```
